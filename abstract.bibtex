  abstract  = {This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical model for a warp bubble that enables faster-than-light travel using positive energy densities, an advancement over traditional models that rely on exotic negative energies. Building on the framework proposed by Eric Lentz, we introduce a non-uniform energy distribution model to enhance control and efficiency in warp field generation. The research validates the stability and feasibility of a warp bubble sustained by positive energy through detailed numerical simulations and analysis. Key findings include the discovery of anisotropic behavior in the warp bubble's structure, which allows for directional tuning of the warp field, thereby optimizing space-time manipulation and reducing energy demands. These results represent a significant step forward in the theoretical foundations of warp drive technology and its potential practical applications.}
